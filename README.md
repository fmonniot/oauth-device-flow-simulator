# OAuth Simulator


## TODO

[x] Bring back Main.Configuration into the watch module
    [x] Configuration type into Watch
    [x] Client ID, polling, Client Secret into the Watch view too
    [x] Update/Msg should be in the Watch module as well
[ ] Make the simulator about OAuth, not just device flow
    [ ] Once Watch have been completed (see first point), add tabs to the Header to choose which OAuth flow to use
[x] Add a "stop polling" checkbox to the Watch module
[ ] Look if we can have a Log module which scroll automatically
    Appear we can by using `elm-lang/dom` (http://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/dom/1.1.1/Dom-Scroll)
[ ] Add documentation for the whole project
    [ ] Expose documentation for all modules in `elm-package.json`
    [ ] Generate documentation
    [ ] Write missing doc ;)
